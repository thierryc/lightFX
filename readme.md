## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/lifx-controller.git
cd lifx-controller
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install lifxlan
```
or 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Device Discovery and Configuration

**Automatic Discovery:**
```bash
python lifx_controller.py --discover
```
This will scan your network for LIFX devices and prompt you to name each new device found.

**Manual Device Configuration:**
```bash
python lifx_controller.py --save-device <IP> <MAC> <NAME>
```
Example:
```bash
python lifx_controller.py --save-device 192.168.1.100 d0:73:d5:01:02:03 "Living Room"
```

Optional:
```bash
chmod +x lifx_controller.py
```   

**List Configured Devices:**
```bash
python lifx_controller.py --list
```

### Device Control

**Power Control:**
```bash
# Turn on
python lifx_controller.py --name "Living Room" --command on

# Turn off
python lifx_controller.py --name "Living Room" --command off
```

**Brightness Control:**
```bash
# Set brightness (0-65535)
python lifx_controller.py --name "Living Room" --command setBrightness --args 32768
```

**Color Control:**
```bash
# Set color (hue, saturation, brightness, kelvin)
python lifx_controller.py --name "Living Room" --command setColor --args 32768 65535 65535 3500
```

**Device Status:**
```bash
python lifx_controller.py --name "Living Room" --command status
```

## Configuration File

The tool stores device configurations in `lifx_config.json`. Example structure:
```json
{
  "devices": {
    "d0:73:d5:01:02:03": {
      "name": "Living Room",
      "ip": "192.168.1.100"
    }
  }
}
```

## Known Issues

### Discovery + Use Appears to Fail on LIFX Firmware 3.70

#### Problem
Some users have reported issues with the `lifxlan` library failing to discover and control LIFX devices running Firmware 3.70. This problem may occur due to outdated MAC address mappings or compatibility quirks introduced in this firmware version.

The exact root cause of the issue remains unclear.

#### Affected Versions
- Firmware: 3.70
- lifxlan: Any version

#### Symptoms
- Devices are not discoverable.
- Commands to control devices fail.

#### Workaround / Solution

1. **Update MAC Address Mapping**
   Use the official LIFX app or Apple Home to update the MAC address of your device on the network. 
   This may help the device has been re-registered correctly with your router.

2. **Retry Discovery**
   After updating the MAC address:
   - Restart your LIFX devices.
   - Retry `lifx_controller`.
